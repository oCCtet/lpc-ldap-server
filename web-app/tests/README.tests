README.tests
============

The run-tests Bash script starts the server-under-test
and the DeviceInfo API stub server, and runs various tests
to ensure the server-under-test works properly. The tests
mainly focus on the RESTful HTTP interface correctness.

The run-tests is designed to be run via `npm test` command
from the directory holding the `package.json` file. The tests
use the config/devel.conf configuration, and work on the host.

The tests require the following programs:

 - bash
 - curl
 - jq

Obviously, nodejs and npm are needed as well.
